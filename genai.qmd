# Do you know your input rights?
In academia we hold ethics, honesty, and the values of open science in the highest regard. These principles are the backbone of our academic community and guide our education as well as our pursuit of knowledge.

Now that AI tools become more advanced and widespread, it is crucial to uphold these values. While much focus has been on the output of AI tools, I want to bring attention to a different concern: the unjust use of what we input into these tools.

Many of us interact with AI in what feels like the privacy of our own devices. This perceived privacy can create a false sense of security, leading some to input information that was not theirs to share or should have remained confidential. To safeguard our integrity and respect intellectual property rights, we must be cautious about what we share with AI tools. Specifically,

- Do not input assignments, course materials, scientific manuscripts or any other work without explicit permission from the owners.
- Avoid using AI tools to process, summarize, grade or evaluate each other's work unless you have the authorâ€™s consent.

By following these guidelines, we protect and respect both the creative efforts and the intellectual property in our community.

## My advice
Generative AI can be a great assistant in the generating structured language. Most of the markup and programming skills that we will consider in this course are extremely structured and generative AI can seem of great help. Mastering a new language, however, requires practice and becoming dependent on genAI will hinder your progression in the long run, or even make you pathologically dependent on AI. Therefore we advice you to also interact with your instructors, peers and other resources around the web, as it will transform you from a leecher into a seeder. Or in educational terms: if you can explain to others what and why you are doing, you have transformed from student to master. Only if you have those metacognitive skills you have the proper foundation to start using generative AI.
